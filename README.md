# battleship-game

This is a simple battle ship game for two local players! When you click start, you will be presented with player 1's board with the ships randomly placed. Player 2's board will be beside it.

The players must trade the computer back and forth, trying to hit each other's ships as they go! A future goal for the project is play between two computers.

HAVE FUN!
